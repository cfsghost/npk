Usage
-

Install NPK globally via NPM:
```
npm install npk -g
```

Using command to pack your project:
```
npk tests/purejs/
```

After packaging, NPK will create a new folder `out` for package. You can find out the package in there:
```
tests/purejs/out/app.js/
```

Finally, you can run packaged application directly:
```
node tests/purejs/out/app.js/app.js
```

Three levels for packaging
-

NPK has special and funny options for three levels for packaging your project.

__Remove Mock-up (default)__
```
npk [project path]
```

__Mom doesn't recognize__
```
npk [project path] --mom-doesnt-recognize
```
__Dad doesn't recognize__

At this level, NPK is packaging your project with C/C++ compiler, to generate a Node.js native module.
```
npk [project path] --dad-doesnt-recognize
```

Note that the third level will attempt to compile all things with machine code then saving as a binary file. It means packed application is not going to work on cross-platform. If you need to support several various platform for your project, it must re-package you application on specific platform what you want.

Note for Windows Users
-

Generating Node.js native module requires C/C++ compiler and Python development. You must install Visual Studio(Express version is fine) and Python 2.7(NOT 3.x) before using "Dad doesn' recognize" option.

How it works
-

NPK is similar to general compiler for computer language. With linking and managing symbol table, NPK can bundle multiple JavaScript source code files, that's just like that compiler is getting objects for making a single binary file.

Actual mechanism to package JavaScript source code files:

1. Getting source files defined in the 'npk_target' property in package.json.
2. Generating symbol table for storing source code files.
3. Linking and bundling symbol table files to generate a single file.
